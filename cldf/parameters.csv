0,Lexifier language for atlas map,"To help the reader’s orientation, we have classified our languages into English-based, Dutch-based, 
Portuguese-based, and so on. This classification is not entirely uncontroversial. On the one hand, 
contact languages are characterized by strong influence from multiple languages, so saying, for 
instance, that Haitian Creole is French-based is problematic, as it glosses over the very important 
contribution of the African languages, especially to the grammar of the language. For this reason, 
many authors have used expressions like “French-lexified”, “Dutch-lexified” for such languages, 
which only refer to the role of the European languages as primary lexicon-providers. We agree that 
such terms are more precise, but they are also more cumbersome, so we have mostly used the older 
(and still much more widespread) manner of talking about groups of creoles and pidgins. We think 
that it is sufficiently well-known that “English-based” (etc.) is not meant to imply anything other 
than that the bulk of the language’s lexicon is derived from English.

On the other hand, the notion of being based on a language is problematic in the case of languages 
with several lexifiers, especially Gurindji Kriol and Michif. These are shown as having two 
lexifiers (or lexifier ""other""). There are also a few other cases where it is not fully clear what
the primary lexifier is. Saramaccan’s vocabulary has a very large Portuguese component, but for 
simplicity we classify it as English-based here. Papiamentu is often thought to be originally 
(Afro-)Portuguese-based, but as it has long been influenced much more by Spanish, we classify it 
as Spanish-based.",,,primary,,,true,,,,100d93e3979d1c185744133c5e5cbd03,{}
1,"Order of subject, object, and verb","This feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 81, by Matthew S. Dryer) concerns the ordering of subject, object and verb in non-contrastive, non-focussed transitive clauses without special topicalization, more specifically declarative clauses with both the subject and object realized as full nouns (not as pronouns). 
     We use <span style=""font-style: italic;"">subject</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">object</span> in a semantic sense, to refer to the agent-like and patient-like constituents in a monotransitive clause, as in e.g. French [<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Les souris</span>] <span style=""font-style: italic;"">mangent</span> [<span style=""font-style: italic;"">le fromage</span>] 'The mice eat the cheese'. As can be seen from this example, French has SVO order (Subject-Verb-Object), because the subject <span style=""font-style: italic;"">les souris</span> 'the mice' precedes the verb and the object <span style=""font-style: italic;"">le fromage</span> 'the cheese' follows it. Since we only consider non-contrastive, non-focussed, non-topicalized clauses, cases like English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">It is the cheese that the mice eat</span> (=OSV) are disregarded here. 
	There are six logically possible orders of subject, object and verb, as shown in the list of feature values.

102,Negation and indefinite pronouns,"This feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 115, by Martin Haspelmath) concerns the expression of negative sentences with indefinite pronouns such as ‘I didn’t see anything’ or ‘Nobody came to my house’. The question asked here is whether in such sentences the indefinite pronoun co-occurs with predicate negation (e.g. English<span style=""font-style: italic;""> I did not see anybody</span>), or whether the indefinite pronoun precludes it (i.e. does not allow negation to be used, e.g. English<span style=""font-style: italic;""> I saw nobody/*I did not see nobody</span>). Note that in this feature, we are not interested in whether the indefinite pronoun itself carries negative meaning, i.e. the issue of “double negation” is left aside. Sentences like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I didn’t see anybody</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I didn’t see nobody</span> have the same status (indefinites cooccur with predicate negation). The reason for this is that in many languages it is hard to tell whether an indefinite pronoun is “inherently negative”. The indefinite words used in such sentences are not always special pronouns, but are sometimes generic nouns like ‘person’, or ‘thing’ (as in Feature 21).",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,false,115A,206,"Negation, questions, and focusing",f3656c67a695350d60189b2c78eb2b43,{}

The most common coding types are intonational coding and segmental coding (by a particle or by an affix on the verb). In addition to segmental and intonational marking, polar questions may be marked by special word order (as in English) and by an A-not-A pattern (as in Mandarin Chinese).

105,Verb doubling and focus,"This feature is about the possibility of doubling the verb in order to focus on the situation referred to by the verb. 
There are two main kinds of verb doubling constructions: the fronting of the verb with a copy of the verb left in the background clause, and the reduplication of the verb within the matrix clause.

The focus particle indicates that its referent is added to a previously mentioned set of referents. The effect of such particles is to focus on a certain constituent, normally a noun phrase or adverbial phrase. (Focus on verbs involves additional complexity and is disregarded in this feature.)

108,Para-linguistic usages of clicks,"While only a few languages in southern Africa have click sounds (velaric ingressive consonants) in ordinary words, many languages can use clicks as para-linguistic, interjection-like gestures. This feature follows <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 142, by David Gil. 
Such usages of clicks are not systematically described by linguists, but they show interesting patterns. In some languages, clicks may have only logical meanings, i.e. ‘no’ or ‘yes’. In others, they may have only affective meanings, i.e. meanings such as disapproval, surprise, or disdain. English is such a language (the alveolar click is sometimes spelled “tsk” or “tut”). There are also languages where clicks can have both logical and affective meanings, and finally, some languages do not have para-linguistic clicks at all.
(Click sounds are consonants that are articulated with two closures in the oral cavity. After the pocket of air enclosed between these two closures is rarefied by a sucking action of the tongue, the release of the forward closure produces the characteristic click sound; phoneticians describe clicks as having <span style=""font-style: italic;"">velaric ingressive airstream</span> mechanism.)",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,false,142A,143,Lexicon,fe0d4f8e7660348e221f572b98561885,{}

	Identity: There is identity if a single word is used to express ‘to hear’ or ‘to smell’ and no word exists that denotes only ‘to hear’ or only ‘to smell’.
	Overlap: This refers to cases where there are two different (possibly related) words, but one of them denotes ‘to hear’ and ‘to smell’, and the other one denotes only ‘to hear’ or only ‘to smell’.
	Identity and differentiation: This constellation is a combination of the first two values: There are at least three (possibly related) words; one denotes only ‘to hear’, one denotes only ‘to smell’ (differentiation), and the third denotes ‘to hear’ or ‘to smell’ (identity).",hubermagnus,,primary,,,false,,,Lexicon,855edaaca34d467438b69deda87df67b,{}

By basic colour terms we mean words whose “meaning is not predictable from the meaning of [their] parts”, whose “signification is not included in any other color term”, whose “application must not be restricted to a narrow class of objects”, and which are “psychologically salient for informants” (Berlin &amp; Kay 1969: 6). 
– Differentiation: One basic colour term denotes ‘green’ and another denotes ‘blue’.
– Identity: A single basic colour term denotes either ‘green’ or ’blue’ and there is no term that denotes only ‘blue’ or only ‘green’.
– Overlap: This covers cases of semantic overlap, where there are two different basic colour terms, but one of them denotes ‘green/blue’, and the other one denotes only ‘green’ or only ‘blue’.
– Not applicable: The language does not have a basic colour term for 'green' or for 'blue', or both.

Lexicalized pairs such as English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">bull-cow</span> are disregarded, as are unproductive patterns like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">fox-vixen</span>, even if they are etymologically related.
	The question whether the base word, apart from the generic meaning, can also denote only the female or only the male animal (like English<span style=""font-style: italic;""> tiger</span> meaning ‘male and female tiger’ or only ’male tiger’) is irrelevant for this feature. Also irrelevant is the token frequency of the element, that is, sex-denoting elements for animals that are rarely referred to count the same as those for animals that speakers talk about more frequently. As to the type frequency, as long as there is at least one word among all the words for animals that can receive a sex-denoting element, this suffices for a value to be set to “true”, the actual frequency of the particular pattern in comparison to other patterns attested in the same language is indicated in the relative importance field in the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span> database.

17,Special dependent person forms for subject and object,"All languages have independent personal pronouns (words like 'I', 'you, 'he', 'we', etc.) that can occur on their own or in constructions in which they are singled out (focus constructions, coordination constructions). 
In addition, some languages have a special set of dependent person forms, which only occur together with a verb. They may be clitics or affixes, but the crucial characteristic is that they cannot be focused, coordinated or occur as an independent utterance. Thus, the weak French subject pronouns (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">je, tu, il,</span> etc.), the Spanish clitic object pronouns (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">me, te, lo, nos</span>, etc.), and also the Spanish subject person markers or verbs (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">quiér-o </span>'I want', <span style=""font-style: italic;"">quiér-es</span> 'you want') count as dependent person foorms.

Some languages even distinguish more than two degrees of politeness, by having distinct forms for intimate address, for neutral address, and for polite address.

2,Order of possessor and possessum,"This feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 86, by Matthew S. Dryer) concerns the word order within attributive possessive constructions, i.e. the order of the possessor noun phrase with respect to the head noun (or possessum).
	We restrict ourselves to the position of possessive noun phrases containing (full) nouns, rather than those involving only a pronominal word or affix. This is because in some languages pronominal possessors occur in different positions than nominal ones. 
	Whether or not the construction involves other words or affixes on the head or the possessor noun is irrelevant for this feature. For example, in a number of pidgins and creoles a third person possessive pronoun is placed between the possessor and the possessum (cf. Feature 38 “Marking of possessor noun phrases”).
	The term <span style=""font-style: italic;"">possession</span> is used in this context in a broad sense, including of course ownership like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">the old lady’s dog</span> but also (a) kinship relations and possession of body parts, as in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mary’s mother</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mary’s foot</span>, and (b) the subjective and objective genitive with action nominals, where the possessor would be the subject or object in a sentential paraphrase, e.g. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">the teacher’s efforts</span> or the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">pupil’s detention.</span>",hubermagnus,,primary,,,true,86A,1248,Word order,b3dc0ab56d33ff4c6a47b8ec6e2a17fa,{}
20,Pronoun conjunction,"Here we ask how a language treats notional conjunction of singular personal pronoun and full noun phrase, as in 'Mary and I', or 'you and your brother'. Most commonly, languages use a singular pronoun that is overtly conjoined (by an 'and' word) with the full noun phrase. But they may also use an inclusory pronoun which denotes the entire set and that is combined with a subset NP that denotes a proper subset, e.g. ""we # Mary"" means 'we including Mary', i.e. 'Mary and I'. The inclusory pronoun can be simply juxtaposed, or combined with the subset NP by a marker, or or followed by a numeral. Finally, the singular pronoun may be simply juxtaposed with the other conjunct.",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,true,,,Nominal categories,33077f3f771a249545a5afbafc7e3c04,{}

Especially human nouns tend to show plural marking when plural marking is not invariant in the language. Languages with the second value have optional plural marking but restrict it to human nouns. Languages with the third value have optional plural marking of all nouns.

Definite NPs are NPs whose referent can be uniquely identified by the hearer, as in anaphoric situations, to refer back to something mentioned in the preceding discourse (e.g. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I bought a new bicycle... My husband likes the bicycle</span>), or in associative contexts, to refer to something that is not mentioned in the preceding discourse but that is identifiable because of an associative relationship (e.g.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> I bought a new bicycle. The saddle is very comfortable</span>). 
A demonstrative is a word that can be used with a pointing gesture. Demonstratives are often diachronically extended to definite articles, so quite a few languages have words that can be used both to express definiteness (even in associative contexts) and as demonstratives.

     Personal pronouns expressing possessors may be separate words (preceding or following the possessum), or affixes (prefixes or suffixes) on the possessum). Another possibility is that pronominal possessors are linked to the possessum by an adposition, with the adpositional phrase preceding or following the possessum.",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,true,,,Nominal syntax,9355df16eaf2d7af41c26c638192843e,{}

Possession is defined broadly as comprising ownership, part-whole relations and kinship relations (and of course normally other abstract relations as well, but these three are criterial.) 
Often pronominal possessors are treated differently from full noun phrases. Here we only look at (non-pronominal) full noun phrases. (For pronominal possessors, see Feature 37.)

4,Order of adposition and noun phrase,"For this feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 85, by Matthew S. Dryer), an adposition is defined as a separate free word that stands before, inside or after a noun phrase and establishes a grammatical or semantic relationship between the noun phrase and a verb in the same clause. Three types of adpositions occur in our languages: prepositions stand before, postpositions after, circumpositions both before and after a noun phrase. Since our criterion is that an adposition indicates some kind of relationship between a noun phrase and a verb, as in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">speak of the devil,</span> attributive possessive constructions like t<span style=""font-style: italic;"">he tail of the dog</span> are disregarded here because they only establish a relationship between the nouns <span style=""font-style: italic;"">tail</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">dog,</span> but not between either of them and a verb. Note that we also disregard case affixes on nouns, which in some languages have functions that are similar to adpositions in European languages. On the other hand, cliticized relation markers, which are phonologically integrated into the noun but whose position depends on syntax do count as adpositions for the purposes of this feature.",hubermagnus,,primary,,,true,85A,1185,Word order,52fa7df9a643b33cd387985bea631a19,{}
40,Gender agreement of adnominal adjectives,"Gender may be subdivided into two types: sex-based distinctions vs. grammatical gender. Sex-based distinctions are probably found in all languages of the world; in Papiamentu (Caribbean, Ibero-Romance-based), for example, there is a contrast between <span style=""font-style: italic;"">mama</span> ‘mother’ and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">tata</span> ‘father’. This contrast, however, is a matter of lexical semantics. By contrast, grammatical gender requires syntactic evidence, called agreement. Agreement may be exhibited, for example, by verbs, adjectives, determiners, or numerals. An example of a language displaying agreement is French, as in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">un grand clocher</span> ‘a (m.) big (m.) church steeple’ vs. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">une grande table</span> ‘a (f.) big (f.) table’. In these examples, both the indefinite article and the adjective agree with their noun in gender.",maurerphilippe,,primary,,,false,,,Nominal syntax,4d6c246284bf695f89b2f69e41c77a5a,{}
41,Comparative adjective marking,"In this feature, we investigate the marking of degree on adjectives in comparative constructions of inequality such as English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mary is taller than Peter, </span>where a comparee NP (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mary</span>) is compared with a standard NP (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Peter</span>) with respect to a parameter (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">tallness</span>). In such constructions, many (especially European) languages mark the adjective either by a suffix, e.g. English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">-er </span>in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">tall-er</span>, or by a degree word, e.g. French <span style=""font-style: italic;"">plus</span> 'more' in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">plus grand </span>'bigger'. 
	We use <span style=""font-style: italic;"">adjective</span> here in a semantic sense  to refer to gradable property concepts, e.g. 'big', 'small', 'short', 'long' (cf. also Feature 3 on order of adjective and noun). Morphosyntactically these property concepts can be encoded as verbs, nouns, or as a separate word class (adjectives).	
           In comparative constructions, the standard can be marked in various ways (see Feature 42 on comparative standard marking). For the present feature, we only consider constructions in which the standard is present (e.g. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Peter</span> in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mary is taller than Peter</span>), not constructions in which the standard is contextually omitted (e.g. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mary is taller</span>), because some languages use a different construction when the standard is not expressed.",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,true,,,Nominal syntax,dfafe84fc33e5b16c6739a0b599cf3b3,{}
42,Comparative standard marking,"In this feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 212, by Leon Stassen), we consider the marking of the standard in comparative constructions. In a construction such as English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">John is taller than Peter, </span>the standard is the entity Y (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Peter</span>) to which the topic X (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">John</span>) is compared, marked by the particle <span style=""font-style: italic;"">than</span> in English (see also Feature 41, “Comparative Adjective Marking”). 
Here we consider only comparative constructions involving adjectives. (We use <span style=""font-style: italic;"">adjective</span> in a semantic sense, as in Feature 3, ”Order of adjective and noun”, to refer to words denoting gradable property concepts.) 
The standard markers are classified by the salient other meanings that they have in addition to that of marking the standard. Surpass markers also occur as (or are closely related to) a verb meaning ‘surpass’ or ‘exceed’. Locational markers have a locational sense (ablative, allative, locative), or a dative sense. Particle markers are specialized for standard marking, or at least have no ‘surpass’ or locational meaning (English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">than</span> and French <span style=""font-style: italic;"">que</span> belong here). Primary surpass marking refers to constructions such as 'John surpasses Peter in tallness', while secondary surpass marking refers to constructions such as 'John is tall, surpassing Peter'. In conjoined constructions, there are two separate predications ('John is tall, Peter is short').",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,true,121A,167,Nominal syntax,926ee5bb77bfd9eba1225c7e23dd4382,{}

49,Tense-aspect systems,"Languages may have different kinds of tense-aspect systems.  Regarding tense, we look only at present and past situations; in the aspectual domain, we restrict ourselves to the opposition of perfective vs. imperfective.
	A purely aspectual system only has a perfective aspect marker (possibly realized as a zero morpheme) that normally refers to perfective past situations, and an imperfective marker, which can be used both in present and past situations (ongoing process, current state or habitual situation). A purely temporal system only marks past, present, and future situations, regardless of aspect. A mixed tense-aspect system possesses both tense and aspect markers, as happens in most Romance languages (cf. French <span style=""font-style: italic;"">passé composé/passé simple </span>vs. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">imparfait</span>).  For this value, it is not important whether tense marking is obligatory, optional or bound to certain contexts.
	The difference between a purely aspect system and a mixed tense-aspect system lies above all in the domain of the imperfective aspect.  In contrast to a mixed tense-aspect system, a purely aspectual system cannot mark the difference between present and past imperfective (i.e. between 'she <span style=""font-style: italic;"">is</span> working' and 'she <span style=""font-style: italic;"">was</span> working').
            The last value is reserved for languages which do not mark tense or aspect morphologically, but lexically (usually with time adverbs), or to languages that possess only one tense or aspect marker.",maurerphilippe,,primary,,,false,,,Verbal categories,b04a821d17d906cff14833eafc71d550,{}

In these cases, the first verb refers to a story-line event, and the second verb refers to a backgrounded event.
Note that in this context, verb chain is understood as being similar to serial verb constructions (absence of overt marker of coordination, subor¬di¬nation, or syntactic dependency of any sort); but, in contrast to serial verb constructions, verb chains refer to two (or more) consecutive actions whereby the second verb does not modify the other verb in any way.",maurerphilippe,,primary,,,false,,,Verbal categories,40becf880279bd646a2beda99bf0cf88,{}

In strong suppletion, there are two different stems that share no phonological material at all (as English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">go</span> vs. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">went</span>), whereas in weak suppletion, the two irregularly related stems share some phonological material (as English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">think</span> vs. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">thought</span>). 
Formal irregularity is determined by synchronic, not by diachronic criteria; therefore, the historical origin of the suppletive forms and their etymologies are not taken into account here.",maurerphilippe,,primary,,,false,79A,193,Verbal categories,92a7c10bb95dc26878e27af506d8df8f,{}
55,Ability verb and epistemic possibility,"In this feature, we ask whether epistemic possibility (”perhaps, possibly”) can be expressed by the same verb as ability. This is the case in quite a few languages, e.g. German <span style=""font-style: italic;"">kann</span>: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Er kann morgen kommen</span> (i) (ability) ‘He can come tomorrow’, (ii) (epistemic possibility) ‘He will possibly come tomorrow’. But in many other languages, this is not the case.
	By ability, we refer broadly to various non-epistemic possibility types comprising mental participant-internal ability (French <span style=""font-style: italic;"">savoir</span>: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Il sait nager</span> ‘He can swim’), physical participant-internal ability (”He can lift 100 kilos”), and participant-external possibility (”She can go to town by bus”, i.e. because there is a bus connection).

56,The prohibitive,"This feature deals with the prohibitive and is based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 71, by Johan van der Auwera &amp; Ludo Lejeune (with Valentin Goussev). The prohibitive is the negated counterpart of the affirmative imperative, as in Papiamentu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">No bai!</span> ‘Don't go!’. Only the singular prohibitive is considered here.
Prohibitives often have special negators that are not used in declaratives, e.g. Tok Pisin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">maski</span> 'don't!'. 
They may also use a special imperative construction that is not used with affirmative imperatives, e.g. Pichi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">mek yù no laf **</span>19-104**<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>'Don't laugh!'

57,Marking of patient noun phrases,"Here we look at the marking of the patient argument in typical transitive clauses (’David killed Goliath’, ‘The girl picked the flower’, etc.), i.e. what is often called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">direct object</span>. We restrict our attention to full noun phrases, as pronouns are often treated in a special way.
     We ask whether patient noun phrases may have case-marking or adpositional marking that distinguishes them from agents (i.e. accusative marking), and if so, under what conditions it occurs. (Of course, fixed word order may also distinguish agents and patients, but this is not considered patient marking here.) Note that by presence of marking, we mean possibility of marking. In many languages, patient marking is optional and need not occur where it can occur.",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,false,,,Argument marking,eb24ca24436a3300b40b828e04bb3cf3,{}
58,Alignment of case marking of full noun phrases,"Here we look at alignment of case marking of full noun phrases, following <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 58, by Bernard Comrie. Alignment refers to the comparison between the marking of the A (transitive agent/subject) argument and the P (transitive patient/object) argument with the marking of the S (intransitive subject) argument. Here only the alignment of case/adpositions is considered, and only the marking of full NPs (person forms are treated in Feature 59). Neutral alignment refers to situations where both A and P are coded like the S. In accusative alignment, A is coded like the S and P is coded in a special way (by accusative case). In ergative alignment, P is coded like the S and A is coded in a special way (by ergative case).",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,false,98A,190,Argument marking,4d4c4797d1a3e2e666f876d1d4d915f3,{}

6,Order of cardinal numeral and noun,"In this feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 89, by Matthew S. Dryer), we look at the order of the cardinal numeral with respect to the noun that it modifies, whether it precedes the noun ('five houses') or follows the noun ('houses five'). Cardinal numerals are words that denote the number of things that are referred to by the noun phrase, and they contrast with ordinal numerals, which specify the rank in some order of objects, as in 'fifth chair' (see Feature 35).",haspelmathmartin michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,true,89A,1154,Word order,4da39e5f2f51e8d2388ca875baccb655,{}
60,Ditransitive constructions with ‘give’,"Ditransitive constructions with the verb ‘give’ have an agent, a recipient and a theme argument. Here we ask how the adpositional or case coding of the recipient and theme compare with the coding of the patient of the ordinary transitive (monotransitive) construction (following <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 105, by Martin Haspelmath). If the recipient receives special marking (generally by a preposition, or by a serial verb), and the theme is coded like the monotransitive patient, we are dealing with an <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">indirect-object construction</span> (something like “I gave book <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">to</span> John”, cf. monotransitive “I bought book”). If the theme receives special marking, and the recipient is coded like the monotransitive patient, we are dealing with a <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">secondary-object construction</span> (something like “I gave John <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">with</span> book”, cf. monotransitive “I saw John”). If neither the recipient nor the theme receive special marking, and both are coded like the monotransitive patient, we have the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">double-object construction</span> (something like “I gave John book”).

Usually the forms used in such circumstances are person forms. Many languages require subject pronouns which are words, but subject person forms may also be affixes, and in quite a few languages they are option. In two languages subject pronouns occur in a different position from subject full noun phrases.",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,false,101A,711,Argument marking,0906b909b2c1acb87622b5774256ad25,{}

Internally headed relative clauses are not adjacent to the notional head, but contain it inside them. 
The head of a correlative relative clause occurs inside the relative clause together with a relative marker and is taken up by a resumptive demonstrative-like element in the main clause.

While European languages generally have the same conjunction marker for both functions, African languages typically use different markers for these two situations.

80,Coming from named places,"This feature examines ‘motion-from’ constructions.  As different kinds of sources can be marked differently, we only take named places into account, e.g. names of villages, cities.

81,Motion-to and motion-from,"While Features 79 and 80 deal with motion-to and motion-from constructions, respectively, in this feature we compare the coding of the two kinds of motion constructions: we investigate whether languages use the same strategy of different strategies to express the two opposite orientations. However in this feature, the goal/source element is not a named place, but a highly frequent place like 'home', 'town', 'village', ‘the market’ or 'the woods'. 
	All European base languages have different constructions for motion-to and motion-from a place in that different prepositions are used: English <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">to </span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">town/</span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">from</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> town,</span> French <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">à</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> la maison/</span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">de</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> la maison,</span> Portuguese <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">ao</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> mercado/</span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">do</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> mercado.
</span>	But in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">APiCS</span>, it is striking to see that many European-based languages do not follow the European pattern and instead mark goal and source <span style=""font-style: italic;"">identically</span>. Thus in Krio the preposition <span style=""font-style: italic;"">na</span> occurs in both contexts, in a motion-to context like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">a di go </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">na</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> di makit **</span>15-104** 'I am going to the market', and a motion-from context like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">a jɛs kɔmɔt </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">na</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> di makit</span>  **15-105**'I just came back from the market.' The hearer has to infer the relevant orientation from the meaning of the verb.",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,false,,,Clausal syntax,9fe4c36bb9dedff5ca975554c8560523,{}
82,Transitive motion verbs: ‘push’,"Features 79 and 80 dealt with intransitive motion-to and motion-from constructions (e.g. 'I go to Leipzig', 'I come from Leipzig'). The present and the following features parallel these two features in that they also analyze motion-to and motion-from constructions, but this time transitive motion constructions with 'push' and 'pull'. 
In this feature, we investigate constructions with the verb 'push' (or semantically very similar transitive motion verbs), as in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lea pushed Maria </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">into</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> the hole</span>. We are especially interested in how orientation or motion-to in this transitive motion verb is expressed in comparison to the corresponding at-rest situation (’to be at a place’). Do we find a special motion-to preposition, such as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">into</span> in the English example cited above, which cannot be used in at-rest contexts (*<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lea is </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">into</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> the hole)</span>? Or does the language use the at-rest preposition also for motion-to, which is for instance the case in Seychelles Creole? (cf. motion-to: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lea ti pus Mari </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">dan</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> trou </span>‘Lea pushed Maria into the hole’, at-rest: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lea ti </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">dan</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> trou</span>. ‘Lea was in the hole’).
Some languages may use serial verb constructions (with or without a preposition) to express the transitive motion construction in question.",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,true,,,Clausal syntax,86ae895b14b0ef5d3ca26473ea5adf52,{}
83,Transitive motion verbs: ‘pull’,"This feature complements the previous features on transitive motion verbs like 'push'. It deals with transitive motion verbs like 'pull' as in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lea pulled Gabriel out of the hole</span>, where the theme (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gabriel</span>) is moved away from a source (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">hole</span>). In the English construction, the source is marked by a combination of two prepositions, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">out of.</span> Other languages, however, have the same preposition in motion-from contexts and in at-rest contexts, e.g. Reunion Creole (motion-from:) <span style=""font-style: italic;"">tir le ros </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">dan</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> la ter  </span>**54-184**<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>'to pull the stones out of the ground', (at-rest:) <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Nana tro d ros </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">dan</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> la ter.</span> **54-185** 'There are too many stones in the ground.'
This kind of polysemous use of the preposition <span style=""font-style: italic;"">dan</span> in Reunion Creole is strikingly different from the situation in its European base language French. In French, transitive motion-from constructions obligatorily show the ablative preposition <span style=""font-style: italic;"">de</span>, as in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">tirer des pierres </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">de</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> la terre</span> 'to pull stones out/from the ground', not the at-rest prepositions <span style=""font-style: italic;"">dans</span> or <span style=""font-style: italic;"">sur</span> (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Les pierres sont </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">dans</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> la terre</span> 'The stones are in the soil').
 	When we speak of at-rest situations, we refer – as in Feature 82 – only to the spatial relations of containment ('in') and attachment ('at') and compare the motion-from constructions with these two kinds of at-rest constructions. The English sentence <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gabriel is out of the hole</span> may also be regarded as a kind of at-rest situation, but here it is implied that the location of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gabriel</span> is a derived one, the result of precisely a motion out of some other location. So if we included all kinds of spatial relations, then even English would have the same marking for at-rest and motion-from. 
	As in Feature 82, there are different means to express transitive motion-from situations, and languages may show several construction types.",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,true,,,Clausal syntax,4cf5f62d642ea6853a84bc5d91590f2e,{}
84,Directional serial verb constructions with 'come' and 'go',This feature is about serial verb constructions in which the second verb (‘come’ or ‘go’) specifies the direction of the action that the first verb refers to.

88,Intensifiers and reflexive pronouns,"This feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 47, by Ekkehard König &amp; Peter Siemund (with Stephan Töpper)) deals with reflexive pronouns. Such pronouns are used to indicate that a non-subject argument of a transitive predicate is coreferential with (or bound by) the subject, i.e. expressions like English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">him-self</span>: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">John</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">1</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> saw himself</span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">1</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> in the mirror</span>. (If a noun like ‘head’ is used in such contexts, or if the ordinary personal pronoun is used, this also counts as a “reflexive pronoun” for present purposes.) 
Intensifiers are expressions like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">him-self</span>, which can be adjoined to either NPs or VPs, are invariably focused and thus are prosodically prominent. The main function of intensifiers can be seen in the evoking of alternatives to the referent of the NP they relate to: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The director himself opened the letter</span> (e.g. not his secretary). 
Here we ask whether intensifiers and reflexives are identical or different. If the reflexive pronoun contains the intensifier (as in Creolese, where <span style=""font-style: italic;"">ii-self</span> is the reflexive pronoun and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">self</span> is the intensifier), this also counts as identity.",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,false,47A,168,Clausal syntax,de7ff990d2552f4d4e852aca34ac84b3,{}
89,Reciprocal constructions,"This feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 106, by Elen Malsova and Vladimir P. Nedjalkov) considers reciprocal constructions (constructions translated with ‘each other’) and compares them in particular to reflexive constructions. Reciprocals may be coded just like reflexives (identity), they may be coded in one of thee subtypes of ""special"" constructions, or there may be both reflexive-like and special reciprocal constructions (overlap, second value). Finally, some languages have no special reciprocal construction and have to use two clauses (“iconic coding”, last value).",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,false,106A,175,Clausal syntax,731b82ede19b5f34bd774e3440886c11,{}
9,Position of definite article in the noun phrase,"A definite article is an element which accompanies nouns and which codes definiteness, like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">the</span> in English. Definite articles need not be obligatory. Definite NPs are NPs whose referent can be uniquely identified by the hearer, as in anaphoric situations, to refer back to something mentioned in the preceding discourse (e.g. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I bought a new bicycle... My husband likes the bicycle</span>), or in associative contexts, to refer to something that is not mentioned in the preceding discourse but that is identifiable because of an associative relationship (e.g.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> I bought a new bicycle. The saddle is very comfortable</span>).",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,true,,,Word order,d5b8afdc4f3332350b5f61ddd7a0989b,{}
90,Passive constructions,"A typical passive construction contrasts with a basic active construction, its subject corresponds to the object of the active and the active subject is expressed as an oblique phrase or dropped, it is pragmatically restricted vis-à-vis the active, and it is marked on the verb by an affix or auxiliary. Passives that lack verbal coding (e.g. Bahamian Creole <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I christen in that church</span>) also occur quite widely. Passives may also be atypical in other ways, e.g. Singlish <span style=""font-style: italic;"">John give his boss scold</span> 'John was scolded by his boss', where the active subject becomes the object of the passive auxiliary <span style=""font-style: italic;"">give</span>.",haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,true,,,Clausal syntax,7942d5bafdfc5356e86f8d8e75b86cbb,{}
91,Applicative constructions,"In an applicative construction, there is an additional (direct) object argument compared to the basic non-applicative construction, and there is an overt marker on the verb. Some languages only allow applicative constructions with transitive bases. The applicative object can have a variety of functions, especially benefactive, instrumental and locative function.

92,Subject relative clauses,"This feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 122, by Bernard Comrie and Tania Kuteva)concerns the expression of relative clauses whose head has the subject role in the relative clause. A relative clause is defined as a clause that helps narrow the reference of a noun (the head) and in which the referent of the noun head has a semantic role. Relative clauses can be marked by a particle or be left unmarked (zero). The role of the head inside the relative clause can be indicated by a gap (no overt expression), or by a resumptive pronoun. The relative clause and the head’s role may also be marked by the same element a relative pronoun. Relative pronouns are forms that have different subject/object forms or can be combined with an adposition. The non-reduction type subsumes the three minor types of Feature 7 (internally headed, correlative, adjoined).",michaelissusannemaria haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,true,122A,166,Complex sentences,a954c5ac1a122d7d6db4cc824e742c1b,{}

95,Complementizer with verbs of speaking,"This feature deals with complementizers (like English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">that</span>) used with verbs of speaking such as ‘say’, ‘tell’, ‘ask’, ‘shout’, ‘whisper’, in a reported speech construction such as <span style=""font-style: italic;"">She told me </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">that</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> she knew it</span>. In general, the constructions that interest us are indirect-speech constructions (with person shift), but when a language does not have a special indirect-speech construction, we also consider direct-speech constructions.
	Complementizers are defined here as elements that do not belong either to the verb of speaking or to the text of the reported speech and link the reported speech to the verb of speaking, normally marking what follows (or precedes) as a complement of the verb of speaking.
In quite a few languages, a form of the verb 'say' is used as a complementizer with verbs of speaking. If the 'say' form is a bare stem, the pattern is often considered as a kind of serial verb construction. 
	In this feature, we investigate asserted reported speech sentences like 'She said that the boy did not feel well', not sentences with directive modality like 'She told the boy to stay in bed', because these latter constructions often yield different syntactic structures.
	 Languages often show several different complementizer constructions.",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,true,,,Complex sentences,9036a1019abcfa4a44501f38b3e5f29d,{}
96,Complementizer with verbs of knowing,"This feature asks about the complementizer used with the verb ‘know’, or similar factive verbs of cognition such as ‘learn’ or ‘forget’. The complementizer is often related to 'say' (either identical to bare 'say' or 'say' plus some other marker), but it may be unrelated to 'say'.",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,true,,,Complex sentences,bd99683ee41b9b6a8e00724b2b1b4e8c,{}
97,‘Want’ complement subjects,"In this feature (based on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">WALS</span> feature 124, by Martin Haspelmath), we look at same-subject complement clauses of ‘want’ (e.g. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">She wants to go home</span>). The main question is whether the ‘want’ complement clause, whose subject is referentially identical with the ‘want’ subject, contains an overt subject pronoun, or is left implicit. Some languages do not use a ‘want’ verb, but instead have a desiderative affix on the verb, or an uninflected adverb-like particle meaning ‘want’.",michaelissusannemaria haspelmathmartin,,primary,,,true,124A,283,Complex sentences,40e41cdb99468982292942dacf9a10ab,{}
98,Complements of 'think' and 'want',"In the present feature, we consider the similarities and differences between two complement clause types. On the one hand, we consider complement clauses which depend on the verb ‘think’ and where the subject of the main clause is different from the subject in the complement clause (e.g. English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">She thinks that her son is at home</span>). On the other hand, we look at complement clauses of ‘want’ where the subject of the matrix clause is again different from the subject in the complement clause (e.g. English <span style=""font-style: italic;"">She wants her son to come home</span>). For same-subject complement clauses of ‘want’, see Feature 97 (“Want complement subjects”). 
	In comparing these two complement clause types, two separate parameters are relevant: 
	(i) whether there is an overt complementizer, and
	(ii) if so, whether both complement types show the same complementizer or different complementizers.",michaelissusannemaria,,primary,,,false,,,Complex sentences,60b55fdfe2b0124f92f7b12169a45315,{}
99,Verb doubling in temporal clauses,"In some creole languages, a verb doubling construction can be used to express temporal adverbial clauses, and sometimes other types of subordinate clauses as well.
